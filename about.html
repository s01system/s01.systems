        <p>
            What does it mean to make electronic music sustainably? s01system is a solar-powered creative tech lab that explores the intersection of music technology and the environment through sound, code, and community.

        <p>
            Borrowing ideas from permacomputing, we experiment with new ways of creating, experiencing and releasing music sustainably. Led by Duncan Geere and Kotte Aistre, alongside an ever-evolving roster of collaborators, our aim is not to provide final answers, but to explore ideas that point toward a future for music and our planet that's worth being excited about.
